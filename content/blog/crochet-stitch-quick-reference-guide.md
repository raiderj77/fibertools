# Crochet Stitch Quick Reference — Yarn Overs, Pull-Throughs & Turning Chains Explained

You know how to double crochet. You've done it a thousand times. But mid-project, your brain blanks: "Wait, is it yarn over then pull through two twice, or three times?" You put the hook down, pull up a YouTube video, skip through the intro, and finally get the three-second reminder you needed.

This guide is that three-second reminder — in text form, always available, no video scrubbing required.

## The Universal Pattern

Here's the secret that makes crochet stitches click: every standard crochet stitch follows the same escalating formula. Each stitch is just one extra yarn-over taller than the one before it.

**Single Crochet (SC):** Zero yarn-overs before inserting. Pull through both loops. Turning chain: 1.

**Half Double Crochet (HDC):** One yarn-over before inserting. Pull through all three loops at once. Turning chain: 2.

**Double Crochet (DC):** One yarn-over before inserting. Pull through two, then pull through two again. Turning chain: 3.

**Treble Crochet (TR):** Two yarn-overs before inserting. Pull through two, three times. Turning chain: 4.

**Double Treble (DTR):** Three yarn-overs before inserting. Pull through two, four times. Turning chain: 5.

See the pattern? The number of initial yarn-overs goes up by one each time, and the number of "YO, pull through 2" steps at the end matches. Once you internalize this, you'll never need to look up a basic stitch again.

## The Stitches You Actually Forget

Nobody forgets how to chain. The stitches people blank on mid-project tend to be:

**HDC** — because the ending is different from every other stitch. Instead of "pull through 2" repeatedly, you pull through all three loops at once. That's the one exception to the pattern above, and it's why HDC trips people up.

**Front and Back Post stitches (FPdc/BPdc)** — because the insertion point is different. You go AROUND the post (the vertical bar of the stitch below) instead of into the top. Everything after that is identical to a regular DC. The only question is direction: front-to-back-to-front for FPdc, back-to-front-to-back for BPdc.

**SSK in knitting** — because the slipping steps feel backwards. You slip two stitches knitwise one at a time, then insert the left needle into the fronts of both and knit them together. The slipping is what reorients them for a left-leaning decrease.

## Loop Counting: Your Debugging Tool

When a stitch goes wrong, the fastest way to find the mistake is counting loops on your hook. If you know how many loops you should have at each step, you can catch errors immediately:

For SC: After pulling up a loop you should have 2 loops. After the final pull-through, you're back to 1.

For DC: After pulling up a loop you should have 3 loops. After the first "pull through 2" you have 2 loops. After the second, you're back to 1.

For TR: After pulling up a loop you should have 4 loops. Each "pull through 2" removes one loop until you're back to 1.

If you count and the number is wrong, you missed a yarn-over or accidentally pulled through too many. Our [Stitch Quick Reference](/stitch-quick-reference) tool shows the loop count at every step for every stitch.

## Turning Chains: Do They Count?

This is one of the most common sources of confusion:

**SC turning chain (1 chain):** Usually does NOT count as a stitch. Work your first SC into the first stitch of the row (the same one the turning chain comes out of).

**DC turning chain (3 chains):** Usually DOES count as the first DC. Skip the first stitch and work your first DC into the second stitch.

**HDC turning chain (2 chains):** Varies by pattern. Check whether the pattern says "ch 2, turn, HDC in first stitch" (does not count) or "ch 2, turn, HDC in second stitch" (counts as first HDC).

Always follow your specific pattern's instructions — different designers have different conventions.

## US vs UK Terms: The One Thing That Confuses Everyone

US and UK crochet terms are offset by one stitch height:

What Americans call Single Crochet, the British call Double Crochet. What Americans call Double Crochet, the British call Treble. And so on up the scale. If a UK pattern says "treble" and you work a US treble (with two initial yarn-overs), your project will be much taller than intended.

Always check whether your pattern uses US or UK terminology. Most patterns state this explicitly. If they mention "tension" instead of "gauge," it's probably British.

## FAQ

### How many yarn overs in a double crochet?
A double crochet has a total of 4 yarn-overs: 1 before inserting the hook, 1 when pulling up the loop, and 2 more during the two "pull through 2" steps. The initial YO before inserting is what gives DC its height.

### What's the difference between front post and regular double crochet?
The only difference is where you insert the hook. In a regular DC, you insert into the top loops of the stitch. In a front post DC (FPdc), you insert around the vertical post of the stitch from front to back to front. The yarn-overs and pull-throughs are identical.

### Why does my half double crochet look different from my double crochet?
HDC pulls through all 3 loops at once, while DC pulls through 2 loops twice. This gives HDC a distinctive third horizontal bar across the top that DC doesn't have. HDC is also slightly shorter.

### How do I remember which crochet stitch is which?
Use the height and turning chain as your anchor: SC = 1 chain, HDC = 2 chains, DC = 3 chains, TR = 4 chains. The turning chain number tells you the stitch height, and the number of "pull through 2" steps at the end always matches the number of initial yarn-overs.

### What's the difference between SSK and K2tog in knitting?
Both are single decreases that reduce 2 stitches to 1. K2tog leans to the right (insert through 2 stitches and knit). SSK leans to the left (slip 2 knitwise, then knit together through back loops). Use them as mirrors for symmetrical shaping.

### Is a slip stitch the same in knitting and crochet?
No. In crochet, a slip stitch means insert hook, yarn over, and pull through both the stitch and the loop on hook in one motion. In knitting, slipping means moving a stitch from one needle to the other without working it at all.
