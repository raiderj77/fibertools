# How to Calculate Stitch Multiples for a Sampler Blanket — The Complete Guide

You've picked out six gorgeous stitch patterns for your sampler blanket. You sit down to figure out your starting chain and suddenly you're staring at a pile of scribbled math. The waffle stitch needs a multiple of 3. The shell stitch needs a multiple of 6 plus 1. The puff stitch wants a multiple of 2. And you need a number that works for *all of them*.

This is the stitch multiple problem, and it trips up crocheters and knitters alike. In this guide, we'll break down exactly what stitch multiples are, how to combine them, and how to plan your sampler blanket from foundation chain to bind-off without any wasted math.

## What Is a Stitch Multiple?

A stitch multiple is the number of stitches that make up one complete repeat of a stitch pattern. If a pattern says "multiple of 4," that means the pattern repeats every 4 stitches. Your total stitch count needs to be divisible by 4 for the pattern to work out evenly.

Many patterns also have a "plus" value. "Multiple of 6 plus 1" means your total needs to be a number like 7, 13, 19, 25 — any number that's divisible by 6 with 1 left over. That extra stitch usually serves as a balancing stitch at the edge so the pattern looks symmetrical.

### Common Multiples by Stitch Type

Simple stitches like single crochet, half double crochet, and double crochet are multiples of 1 — any count works. That's why they're easy. Things get interesting with textured and lacy patterns:

Textured stitches tend to have small multiples. Moss stitch, puff stitch, and grit stitch are all multiples of 2. Waffle stitch and sedge stitch are multiples of 3. Basket weave is a multiple of 6 plus 2.

Lacy stitches often have larger multiples. Shell stitch is a multiple of 6 plus 1. Catherine wheel needs a multiple of 10 plus 6. Feather and fan in knitting is a multiple of 18. The bigger the multiple, the harder it is to combine with other patterns.

## The Math: LCM (Least Common Multiple)

When you need a stitch count that works for multiple patterns, you're looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of their multiples.

For example, if you want to combine patterns with multiples of 3, 4, and 6:

The LCM of 3, 4, and 6 is **12**.

That means any multiple of 12 works for all three patterns: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72... all the way up. If you want a blanket around 150 stitches wide, you'd pick 144 or 156.

### When "Plus" Values Complicate Things

If one pattern is "multiple of 6" and another is "multiple of 4 plus 2," you need a number that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. This is where manual math gets painful. You're essentially solving a system of modular equations.

Our [Stitch Pattern Calculator](/stitch-pattern-calculator) does this automatically — you enter each pattern's multiple and plus value, set your desired width range, and it instantly shows every compatible stitch count.

## Planning a Sampler Blanket Step by Step

### Step 1: Choose Your Stitches

Pick 4-8 stitch patterns for your sampler. A good mix includes a solid section for visual rest, a textured section for interest, and a lacy section for contrast. Here's a popular beginner combination:

1. Moss Stitch (multiple of 2)
2. Waffle Stitch (multiple of 3, needs 4 rows)
3. V-Stitch (multiple of 2 plus 1)
4. Granny Stripe (multiple of 3)
5. Shell Stitch (multiple of 6 plus 1)

### Step 2: Find a Compatible Stitch Count

Enter all five patterns into the calculator. The multiples are 2, 3, 2, 3, and 6 — the LCM is 6. But the V-stitch needs plus 1 and the shell stitch also needs plus 1, so you need a number that's a multiple of 6 plus 1: 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37... up through your target width.

For a throw blanket around 50 inches wide at a worsted-weight gauge of roughly 3.5 stitches per inch, you need about 175 stitches. The nearest compatible counts would be 169 (6×28+1) or 175 (6×29+1). Lucky — 175 works perfectly.

### Step 3: Account for Edge Stitches

If you're adding a border or selvedge stitches, decide on those now. Many crocheters add 1-2 edge stitches per side. These sit outside the pattern repeat, so you'd subtract them before checking compatibility and add them back after.

With 2 edge stitches total (1 per side), you'd need the *pattern portion* to be 173 stitches. Check if 173 is a multiple of 6 plus 1: 173 - 1 = 172, and 172 ÷ 6 = 28.67 — that doesn't work. So try 175 pattern stitches plus 2 edge = 177 total. Or adjust your edge stitch count.

This is exactly the kind of fiddly math the calculator handles for you.

### Step 4: Plan Your Rows

Each stitch pattern has a minimum row repeat — the number of rows needed to complete one full vertical repeat. Waffle stitch needs 4 rows. Shell stitch needs 2. Celtic weave needs 4.

For a professional-looking sampler, each section should be a whole number of repeats. If you want roughly 20 rows of waffle stitch, you'd do exactly 20 (5 repeats of 4) or 24 (6 repeats of 4) — never 22, which would cut a repeat in half.

Our Row Planner tab handles this. Enter your target row count per section and it rounds to the nearest complete repeat, then shows you a visual breakdown of your whole blanket.

### Step 5: Add Transition Rows

Between stitch pattern sections, many crocheters add 1-2 rows of single crochet or half double crochet. This creates a clean visual break and makes it easier to switch patterns. Factor these into your row count — they're multiples of 1, so they work with any stitch count.

## Common Stitch Multiple Combinations That Work Well

Here are some tried-and-true combinations where the math is friendly:

**The "Multiples of 6" Family:** Shell Stitch, Basket Weave, Arcade Stitch, Granny Stripe (which is a multiple of 3, and 3 divides evenly into 6). Use any count that's a multiple of 6 plus whatever your "plus" values need.

**The "Even Number" Family:** Moss Stitch, Puff Stitch, Bobble Stitch, Grit Stitch, Suzette Stitch. All multiples of 2. Any even number works. The simplest combination to plan.

**The "Multiples of 4" Family:** 2×2 Rib, Double Seed Stitch, Celtic Weave, Plaid Stitch. Since 4 is also a multiple of 2, you can mix in any multiple-of-2 stitches too.

## Stitch Multiples to Avoid Combining

Some combinations produce very large LCMs that limit your stitch count options. Catherine Wheel (multiple of 10 plus 6) combined with Feather and Fan (multiple of 18) gives an LCM of 90 — meaning your stitch count options are spaced 90 stitches apart. That's not impossible, but it means you have very few compatible widths to choose from.

As a rule of thumb, if your LCM exceeds 30, your blanket width options start getting restrictive. You can still make it work, but you may need to be flexible on your target width.

## FAQ

### What is a stitch multiple in crochet?
A stitch multiple is the number of stitches in one complete repeat of a pattern. For example, if a pattern is a "multiple of 4," your total stitch count must be divisible by 4. Many patterns also have a "plus" value (like "multiple of 4 plus 1") for edge symmetry.

### How do I find a stitch count that works for multiple patterns?
Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all your pattern multiples. Any multiple of the LCM will work for all patterns. Use our [Stitch Pattern Calculator](/stitch-pattern-calculator) to do this automatically with plus-value support.

### What is the LCM and why does it matter for blankets?
The LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest number that all your pattern multiples divide into evenly. It determines the spacing between compatible stitch counts. A smaller LCM gives you more flexibility in choosing your blanket width.

### How many rows do I need for a complete stitch repeat?
It depends on the stitch. Simple stitches like SC need just 1 row. Waffle stitch needs 4 rows. Celtic weave needs 4. Catherine wheel needs 4. Always complete full repeats so your pattern doesn't get cut off mid-repeat.

### Can I combine stitches with different multiples in a sampler blanket?
Yes — that's exactly what a sampler blanket is. The key is finding a stitch count that works for every pattern in your sampler. The calculator finds all compatible counts within your desired width range.

### What if no stitch count works for all my patterns?
This usually happens when "plus" values conflict. Try swapping one pattern for a similar one with a different plus value, or adjust your edge stitch count. Sometimes adding or removing 1 edge stitch solves the conflict.
